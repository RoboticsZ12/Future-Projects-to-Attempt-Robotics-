The thought of this project is to design a cheap robot that will have the ability of condesning itself into a 
box for storage, then expanding itself out of a box upon activation by an external user. 

The thought is to use a mutiltude of motors to run the arms, legs, and head out of box to operate its functions. 
The main functionality will be a greeting robot to answer pre-programmed questions. Upon the robots expansion out
of the box, the robot will display an Ipad or tablet of sorts for inputs from the user. 

Upon the tablet will be a multitude of questions to ask the robot. The idea is to have the robot answer questions 
about SIUE and the robotics program. Since the mechatronics/robotics program is relatively new, this could be a 
fantastic way of showcasing the robotics program at SIUE. 

BUILD:
1) Tablet for user inputs.
2) Multiple servo motors, or AC motors, to control joints, expansion, and condensing. 
3) Speaker to talk to user. 

FUTURE IDEAS FOR THIS PROJECT:
Make the robot have the ability to be able to receive and respond w/o tablet. ONLY takes in voice from user and 
interprets waht to say according to user voice input.
