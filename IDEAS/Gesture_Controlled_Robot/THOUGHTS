The thought for this project is to create a robot that will have the ability to perform tasks almost like a dog. 
Depending on certain gestures made by the user will determine the output of the robot. Some applications that 
could be helpful could be carrying groceries from the car, fetching something, handshaking, etc. 

BUILD:
1) Robotic vision campera.
2) Obstacle avoidance system.
