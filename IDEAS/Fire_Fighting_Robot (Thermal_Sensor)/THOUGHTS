The thought for this project is to limit the exposure of large, or small, fires to humans. Utilizing thermal sensors to detect 
objects that get hotter than acceptable limits. The device would need to be activated manually to ensure automatic system does 
not shoot what is not neccessary such as stove top. 

BUILD:
1) Infrared Sesor. 
2) Thermal Sensor. 
3) Water supply.
